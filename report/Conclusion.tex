\section{Conclusion}
Our autotuner works, it finds all the possible combinations of paths for a program, with some amount of datasets, and returns the best one for all datasets. With an exhaustive search comes an exponential amount of paths in the worst case, this means that our autotuner is slow on multiple datasts. We have put forth two ideas for future work, and a optimization to the current implementation.
